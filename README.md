# Magnifying Glass

Maps with a Magnifying Glass Tool for Qgis.

This plugin provides the “magnifying glass” tool to compare maps from different providers. The idea is quite simple, but if you don’t want to dig into the code, here is the trick.
Two SlippyMaps are created, the first one serves as an on-top map and the second is rendered below the first and it is the one that is used as “magnifying glass” clipped to the shape of a circle. Simple, isn’t it? Of course, you can still move the maps by dragging the mouse and you can change the maps.

## How It Works

To activate the magnifier you simply have to press "left-click" and hold it down while moving around the map.
You can also leave a magnifying glass fixed with a simple "left-click" and move it over the map with the arrow keys of your keyboard to remove it, you have to press "right-click".
Finally, through the combos above, you can choose the base maps to show both in the map and in the magnifying glass.

  - Mouse buttons (drag): pan
  - Left, right, up, down key: pan
  - Left mouse button (hold): magnifier zoom
  - Mouse wheel, plus and minus keys: zoom in/out

## And… What can it be useful for?
