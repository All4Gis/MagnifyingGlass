# Magnifying Glass
Maps with a Magnifying Glass Tool for Qgis.

This plugin provides the “magnifying glass” tool to compare maps from different providers. The idea is quite simple, but if you don’t want to dig into the code, here is the trick.
Two SlippyMaps are created, the first one serves as an on-top map and the second is rendered below the first and it is the one that is used as “magnifying glass” clipped to the shape of a circle. Simple, isn’t it? Of course, you can still move the maps by dragging the mouse and you can change the maps.
